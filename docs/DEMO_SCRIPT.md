**1:15 - 1:30 | Shield Assets**
- Navigate to Shield tab
- Enter 0.1 SOL
- Show commitment generation

**1:30 - 1:45 | Shadow Transfer**
- Navigate to Transfer tab
- Enter stealth address
- Send 0.05 SOL

**1:45 - 2:00 | Compliance Proof**
- Navigate to Compliance tab
- Select Range Proof
- Set range: $0 - $10,000
- Generate proof
